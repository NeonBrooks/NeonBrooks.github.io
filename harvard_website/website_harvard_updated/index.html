<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Elizabeth Spelke in
the Laboratory for Developmental Studies at Harvard University. Through
my research, I investigate the ways that
we represent complex and abstract information mentally. I am
particularly interested in how and when we make use of analog
forms of representation like action, gesture, and mental imagery; and
how these
might work together with symbolic forms of representation like languge.
<br />
</p>
<p>My work at Harvard focused on two lines of research: in the first, I
am investigating how infants interpret their own actions on the world,
and what information they use to learn from these actions. In the
second, I am investigating the roles that action, gesture, and language
can play on children's understanding of matehematical and geometric
concepts. In this line of work, I am particularly interested in how we
can improve children's learning of difficult mathematical and spatial
concepts, both in the US and in India.<br />
</p>
<p>My doctoral dissertation focused on uncovering the role of gesture
in cognition by making use of
particularly useful case study: children in India who solve arithmetic
problems using the Mental Abacus technique. I have found that these
children gesture
prolifically and in systematic ways, and are impaired in their ability
to do arithmetic when
they are prohibited from planning motor movements.&nbsp; Further, by
training novice abacus users using iPads, I was able to show that the
motor experience of learning the abacus plays a large role in the form
of the gestures that users eventually produce. <br />
</p>
<p>Please see the "Publications" and "Demos" links to learn more about
this work, as well as my other projects on gesture and learning in
grade schoolers and adults and on word learning and conceptual
development in preschoolers. Much of this work is ongoing, and I am
happy to discuss it by email!<br />
